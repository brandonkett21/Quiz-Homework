I have created a multiple choice timed quiz that stores high scores with your initials.

Index.html stores the buttons, containers, outline for each page.

The CSS has the styling for each page

The script.js contains all of the working functions to make the quiz work properly. To move on to the question, to make the timer work, to store the high scores.

You are also able to clear the high scores and view them on the start page.
